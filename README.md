## Features 🐾
Pawssion is a virtual space that strives to connect animal lovers and promote animal welfare across the globe. Our aim is to provide love and care to the numerous innocent animals that are in need. There are individuals who may be unable to own a pet due to time or space constraints, and this is where Pawssion comes in to bridge the gap between animal lovers and their furry companions by offering them to virtually adopt and provide for animals present in animal shelters/NGOs.

Once an individual has decided to adopt an animal, they can keep track of the care being provided to their pet by NGOs through our app. We ensure to maintain the virtual adoption of any animal by providing regular updates on their pets' well-being, including real-time photos and videos.

We recognize that numerous animals are suffering and require assistance. To bring attention to these creatures, we have introduced a Posts Section where users can post images and stories of animals in need, allowing other users and NGOs to take appropriate action to provide assistance.

## Tech Stack 🧑‍💻
We have used Flutter, Dart and Firebase for the App Development
